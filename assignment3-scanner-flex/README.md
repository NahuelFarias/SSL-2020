# Implementing a scanner with Flex

## Objectives

We will be implementing the scanner made on assignment 1 (from scratch), but this time with Flex. We need to keep in mind that all returned tokens are not strictly as the documented ones. These can be modularized for a better implementation, e.g. a token for each keyword, punctuator and operator.

## Remarks

- There must be an `enum` which groups the tokens in `tokens.h`.
- Flex's definition must not contain user's code section. Additional code must be added in `main.c`.
- The scanner implemented with Flex shall:
  - Return the token in case of finding a grammatical element.
    - It will show the corresponding lexeme in case of finding an identifier or integer.
    - It will show the corresponding character in case of finding a single character.
  - Ignore commentaries.
  - Show messages for expected errors with the corresponding lexeme:
    - Invalid string
    - Invalid integer
    - Invalid identifier
- Must use `header-file` and `oufile` directives.

## Suggestions

- Use `noinput` and `nounput` to supress unnecessary warnings.
- The first member of `enum tokens` must be `FDT` (end-of-file).
- Use `yytext` to show lexemes in `main.c`.

## Compile

```
flex scanner.l
gcc -o scanner *.c -lfl
```

## Run

```
./scanner <input.txt
```
